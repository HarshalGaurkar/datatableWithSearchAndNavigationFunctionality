#### **Lightning Web Component: DataTable with Navigation & Search**  

This **Lightning Web Component (LWC)** displays a list of **Opportunities** in a **scrollable datatable**, allowing users to:  
- **View Opportunity Details** by clicking the record name.  
- **Edit Opportunity Records** with an action button.  
- **Search Opportunities** dynamically using a search box.  
- **Navigate to Record Pages** using Lightning Navigation Service.  
- **Show Only 5 Records at a Time**, with a scrollbar for additional records.

### **Scenario**  

A **Sales Representative** wants a quick overview of **Closed Won Opportunities** in a table format.  
- They can **search by name** to find a specific record.  
- They can **view** an opportunity in a new tab.  
- They can **edit** an opportunity directly from the table.  
- If there are more than 5 records, they can scroll to see additional opportunities.  

This component **enhances user efficiency** by providing a quick, interactive way to manage opportunities **without navigating multiple pages**.
